# 🌐 Google Clone

This project replicates Google's main interface created with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** to show how it is possible to build clean, responsive and functional web experiences. It is an excellent basis for understanding how to structure a visually appealing search engine, with features such as theme switching (light/dark mode).
